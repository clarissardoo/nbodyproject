The final project write up is titled "nbody_final.pdf"

The Folders are as follows:


## SCRIPTS ##

All of the calculation scripts can be found under the scripts folder. There are 4 scripts:

1. nbody.c - is the serial version of the N-Body code, currently set with the inner solar system parameters. The user has the freedom to change the timestep, the integration time and the bodies' initial conditions.

This code was run locally using the compiling command: gcc nbody.c


2. nbodyparallel.c - is the parallel version of the N-Body code (using OpenMP), currently set for a 2 Myr integration of 4,000 asteroids with Jupiter and the Sun.

This code was run on Expanse using the compiling command:

gcc -Wall -fopenmp nbody_parallel.c -lm


3. nbodyparallel.sb - is the batch script for running the parallel version of the code using different amounts of threads and outputting the files under a name "particles_nthreads.csv".

4. nbody_parallel_128.sb - is the batch script that runs the parallel code in 128 cores, the one with the fastest output used for the Science Part of the project.



## PLOTTING_SCRIPTS ##

These are the Python Scripts for Data Analysis/Plot generations.

1. gifmaker.py - this is the code responsible for plotting Figures 5 and 6 on the final PDF write up, of the inner solar system and the Jupiter/asteroids plot. This code also produced the output of the GIFS folder. It takes in a CSV file outputted by nbody.c or nbodyparallel.c and plots the particle positions over different time steps.
 
2. speeduptimes.py - this code is responsible for outputting Figures 2,3 and 4 on the final PDF write up. It takes in the wall clock time shown on the nbodyparallel.c CSV file output (which can be found under the CSV_OUTPUTS folder, with subfolders named asteroids[nasteroids]_1year). The code also fits for the quadratic polynomial on Figure 4 using Numpy.


3. histogramplotter.py - this code is responsible for Figure 7 on the final PDF write up. It takes in a CSV output file from nbodyparallel.c, calculates the semi-major axis of each asteroid and then plots a histogram of the asteroid distribution from different time steps.



## CSV_OUTPUTS ## 

These are the output files for the nbodyparallel.c or nbody.c

1. The subfolders asteroids(nasteroids)_1year contain the output results of nbodyparallel.c for 1 year of integration time, with the wall clock time printed. This produced figures 2,3,4 on the write up.

2. The particles_128_2e6.csv file is the output file of nbodyparallel.c for 2 Myr of integration time, outputting the first and last positions of each particle. This produced the histogram on Figure 7 on the paper.

3. particles_innsolar.csv is the output file for nbody.c for the inner solar system planets for 1 Earth Year. This produced Figure 5 on the final writeup.

4. particles_gif.csv is the output file of nbodyparallel.c for 1,000 asteroids in 31 years, similar to what is shown on Figure 6 of the PDF write up and also what is used to create the gif asteroids.gif under the GIFS folder.



## PLOTS ## 

These are the plots included in the PDF write up.

1. asteroidhist0yr and asteroidhist2myr are the histograms outputted by histogramplotter.py using the particles_128_2e6.csv file (outputted by nbodyparallel.c). These are on Figure 7 in the final PDF write up.

2. asteroidspeed, asteroidtime, fit_128 and fit_both are the plots outputted by speeduptimes.py for the speed up and run time for different amounts of threads and asteroids. They use the CSV outputs of nbodyparallel.c.



## GIFS ##

These are movie animations outputted by gifmaker.py (snapshots of these compose Figures 5 and 6 on the write up).

1. asteroids.gif - a 31 year integration of 1,000 asteroids using nbodyparallel.c CSV outputs.

2. solarsysteminner.gif - a 1 year integration of the inner solar system using nbody.c CSV outputs.
